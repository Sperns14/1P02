		<p>What you are looking at right now is a very good boy. Look at him, look at his face. See? Good boy. Great boy even.
			I will now list the reasons you are looking at a <strong>VERY GOOD BOY</strong>
		</p>
		<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>He does his best</li>
			<li class="bigtext">Those ears</li>
			<li class="greentext">Just look at him he makes me happy he's such a good boy</li>
		</ul>

		<br/>

		<h2 class="h2"> This is NOT a good boy </h2>
			<img src="bear.jpg" alt="bad boy"/>
		<br/>
			<p>And this, dear reader,is the prime example of a <em> very bad boy </em> Look at him, acting like he owns the place.
				i probably dont need to tell you why, but here are some reasons this is a very bad boy.
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Property damage, like what the heck man you gotta pay for that</li>
				<li>Eating garbage, what are you a savage? Have some self respect man.</li>
				<li>Makes photos blurry, likely with some sort of <strong class="uppercase">reality distorting mind powers.</strong></li>
			</ol>
