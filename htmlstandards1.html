		<ul>
			<li>He does his best</li>
			<li>Those ears</li>
			<li>Just look at him he makes me happy he's such a good boy</li>

			<p>And this, dear reader,is the prime example of a <em> very bad boy </em> Look at him, acting like he owns the place.
				i probably dont need to tell you why, but here are some reasons this is a very bad boy.
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Property damage, like what the heck man you gotta pay for that</li>
				<li>Eating garbage, what are you a savage? Have some self respect man.</li>
				<li>Makes photos blurry, likely with some sort of reality distorting mind powers.</li>
